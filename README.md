# Blank WordPress theme
This is a super-barebones wp-content directory with a minimalistic theme to be used as a starting point for new WordPress websites. It defines some basic helper methods and provides the minimal essentials for a new theme. Stylesheets are compiled by SASS. To compile, run `sass --watch sass:stylesheets` from the `assets` directory.



## Requirements:
* SASS


## Uses:
* Normalize.css (https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)


## ToDo:
* Add more basic template files. Reference for template hierarchy here: https://developer.wordpress.org/files/2014/10/template-hierarchy.png
* Add basic WP loop. Reference for WP Loop here: https://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop
* May expand more in future if it becomes helpful
